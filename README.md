#### The Idea
To create a web service which warns users of potential disasters, provides routes to local safe shelter, along with the function of broadcasting geolation for first responders to find them

For this project we wanted to create an all-in-one disaster aid tool. We came up with three major features we wanted to implement: getting users a quick guide to routes to a safe location, keeping them updated with local events, and providing a location tool for finding anyone who is lost or trapped.
